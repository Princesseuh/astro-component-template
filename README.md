# Astro Component Template

This is a template meant to ease the development of components for [Astro](https://astro.build/). It does so by providing you with:

- A clear default directory structure
- Proper TypeScript settings for working with Astro
- Default settings for ESLint, Prettier and EditorConfig inspired by the formatting used in the Astro project itself (also, [they're typed ðŸ‘€](https://princesseuh.netlify.app/article/youshouldtypeyourconfigfiles/))
- Ready-to-use testing tools powered by the libraries also used by the Astro project (Mocha and Chai), also contain [astro-component-tester](https://github.com/Princesseuh/astro-component-tester) to help you test your component's output
- Preconfigured VS Code workspace settings file with settings meant to make development cozy and nice

Hopefully, all of this together will provide you with a fun and comfortable development environnement for working on your Astro component

**Don't forget:** You should edit `package.json` with the info relevant to your project, such as a proper `name`, a license, a link to the repository for the npm website and other settings

**Note:** At the end of the day, this is only a template meant to get yourself started quickly. If you do not agree with any of the settings, naming conventions, the folder structure or anything else, you can and you should change things so things are easier and nicer for your needs and wants

## Folder Structure

```plaintext
/
â”œâ”€â”€ .vscode/                    # VS Code settings folder
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.json           # Workspace settings
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ extensions.json         # Very strongly recommended extensions to install
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                        # Your component source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Component.astro         # Example component file
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.ts                 # Example source code file
â”œâ”€â”€ test/                       # Your component tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ example.test.js         # Example tests
â””â”€â”€ index.ts                    # Should contain all the exports your component provide to users
```

ESLint, Prettier and EditorConfig settings are respectively located in the following files: `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc.js` and `.editorconfig` at the root of this template project.

## Commands

The following npm scripts are provided to lint and format your project

| Command          | Action                                                        |

## Frequently asked questions

### Is this official?

No, Astro does not have an official template for component and other options than this one exists. At the end of the day, you should choose the one that fits your needs the best!

### Which package manage should I use?

The one you prefer! This template makes no assumption.

The only package manager related thing in this repo is that the prettier plugins has the proper configuration needed to work with pnpm (but it works with the other too, pnpm just need additional settings)
