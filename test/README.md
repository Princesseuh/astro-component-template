# `test` directory

This folder contain tests for your component. This templates makes no assumption regarding your way of writting code. You can either write the code first and then the tests or the reverse (known as Test-Driven Development). Ultimately, what's important is that your code works and is tested to prove it

**Note:** Currently, it's unfortunately not really convenient or simple to test Astro components. So, for now, you should be mainly testing the functions that your component uses to generate its content to make sure it generates the proper things

Included is a commented example test (see `example.test.js`) to show you how to write a basic test for your component
